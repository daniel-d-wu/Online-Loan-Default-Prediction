# Can a machine replace a loan a officer?

In this project, I fit three models to predict charge-offs in Lending Club loans: A (Regularized) Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The purpose of this project is twofold: First, it is to see how well each model performs in comparison to one another. Secondly, I incorporate <b>soft information<\b> in the form of text descriptions provided by the applicant to see whether that improves model performance. As a result, I only include time periods when text descriptions are common (2007 - 2011).
